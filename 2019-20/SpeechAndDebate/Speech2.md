Why do we scream? Why do we make a weird face when we get scared, or angry? Screaming is actually an audible defense, like scratching, kicking, or punching, it gives us a chance it could warn off predators. As for the face you make when you scream, it's apart of the fight or flight response. The fight or flight response is a survival mechanism that activates when something terrifying happens to you. It basically tells you whether you should stay and fight, or run away. 
 Even if you arenâ€™t afraid and you make a face as if you were, it would cause you to be more alert. Your eyes will open wider, and move faster, allowing you to have a wider range of vision, so you can spot danger easier. And you will breath faster, with your nostrils working on a higher sense of smell! If you want to, use this when you're playing a sport, I mean it might look weird but, you can smell better!
  
Screaming can actually reduce stress and anger, in fact, it works so well that some colleges actually encourage students to let out a primal scream to help relieve the stress of finals. Screaming is also a type of physiotherapy, called primal scream therapy. This form of therapy is used to treat anxiety, trauma, and stress. 
 
 If you feel stressed or mad, just scream. Scream in a pillow, a blanket, or scream where no one else can hear you. Screaming is a natural instinct, and could improve your life. Just scream.
